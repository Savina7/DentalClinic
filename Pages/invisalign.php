            <h2>What is Invisalign?</h2>
            <p>
              Invisalign is a modern orthodontic treatment that uses a series of
              clear, removable aligners to gradually straighten your teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aligners are custom-made, virtually invisible, and designed to
              fit seamlessly into your lifestyle.

            <p>
              Invisalign aligners are smooth and comfortable, without the
              irritation often associated with traditional braces.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can remove them to eat, brush, and floss, making it easier to
              maintain excellent oral hygiene throughout treatment.
