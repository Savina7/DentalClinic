            <h2>What is Minor Surgery?</h2>
            <p>
              Minor surgery involves procedures that are less invasive and often
              performed in-office, such as tooth extractions, gum treatments,
              and simple soft tissue procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
              These procedures aim to improve oral health, relieve pain, and
              prevent complications in a safe and controlled environment.

            <summary>Is the procedure painful?</summary>
            <p>
              We use local anesthesia to ensure minimal pain during the
              procedure. Any post-procedure discomfort is manageable with
              recommended care.

            <p>
              Minor surgeries usually have a short recovery time, often just a
              few days, depending on the procedure and patient compliance with
              aftercare.

            <p>
