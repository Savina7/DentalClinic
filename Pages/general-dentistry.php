            <h2>What is General Dentistry?</h2>
            <p>
              General dentistry is the foundation of oral health. It involves
              the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a wide variety of
              conditions affecting the teeth, gums, and jaw. Our primary goal is
              to help you maintain your natural teeth for as long as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              We routinely use magnification to give us a more in-depth view,
              which helps us identify potential problems early—often before you
              even feel discomfort.

            <h2>Advanced Digital Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
              Using digital scanners and Cone Beam CT scans (3D X-rays) helps us
              to plan the best course of treatment with predictable outcomes.
              For people who struggle with “in mouth” X-rays, we have the
              facility to take these extra-orally.
            </p>
            <p>
              This technology ensures that your treatment is not only more
              accurate but also faster and more comfortable than traditional
              methods.
